  Gatsby starter with PNPM/Typescript support
</h1>

Kick off your project with this boilerplate. This starter ships with PNPM and Typescript support, with the main Gatsby configuration files structured so that they can be designed using Typescript, to help you get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-gatsby-starter https://github.com/Js-Brecht/gatsby-starter-pnpm-ts
    ```

2. **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-gatsby-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

```text
.
├── node_modules
├── src
├── .gatsby
    ├── gatsby-config.ts
    ├── gatsby-node.ts
    └── graphql
        ├── introspection.json
        ├── plugin-documents.graphql
        ├── schema.graphql
        └── types.ts

└── tsconfig.json
```

1. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3. **`/.gatsby`**: This directory will contain all of the configuration files, in typescript format, that can be used to configure your Gatsby build.  **NOTE**: `gatsby-browser` and `gatsby-ssr` are not used here because the import/export model needed doesn't play well with certain types of react components.  Just works more reliably to keep them in the project root.

    1. **`/gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

    2. **`/gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

    3. **`/graphql/`**: The folder that will contain project specific graphql schemas and configurations.  These are generated by `gatsby-plugin-typegen`.

        1. **`introspection.json`**: This is used by `eslint` for `graphql` linting.

        2. **`plugin-documents.graphql`**: This is used by the `vscode-apollo` vscode extension.

        3. **`schema.graphql`**: This is also used by the `vscode-apollo` vscode extension.

        4. **`types.ts`**: This contains the type definitions for the `graphql` schema and your `graphql` queries.

4. **`.vscode`**: Storage of workspace specific settings & data for `.vscode` to use.  This includes `gatsby` specific debugger launching configurations for `vscode`.

5. **`.editorconfig`**: The general formatting configuration for `vscode`.

6. **`.eslintrc.js`**: The eslint configuration, which includes linting for `graphql`

7. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

8. **`apollo.config.js`**: This contains the configuration for the `vscode-apollo` vscode extension.

9. **`gatsby-browser.ts`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.  It is okay to write this in Typescript.

10. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This file is an entry point for Gatsby so that it can find and read the Typescript gatsby-config.ts

11. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is an entry point for Gatsby so that it can find and read the Typescript gatsby-node.ts

12. **`gatsby-ssr.ts`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.  It is okay to write this in Typescript.

13. **`gatsby-ts.js`**: This file acts as a generator for `ts-node`, which will be used to read & transpile gatsby configuration files on the fly.

14. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

15. **`pnpm-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

16. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

17. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

18. **`tsconfig.build.json`**: This `tsconfig` configuration is used by `ts-node` for interpreting the `gatsby-*` configurations under the `.gatsby` subdirectory.

19. **`tsconfig.json`**: The standard `tsconfig` configuration needed for writing source in Typescript.
